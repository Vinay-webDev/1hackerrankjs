There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

ðŸ‘‰The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
ðŸ‘‰The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.
